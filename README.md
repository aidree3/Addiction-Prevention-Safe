# Addiction-Prevention-Safe
The initial design was created for our CS 362 (Computer Design) class. Now it is a project we are trying to further improve.

Our project is to implement a safe-like device that is designed to keep the user away from wasting their time on certain tasks (e.g. phone usage, etc). The safe will use some security features such as the requirement of a password as well as a timer which will make the safe unable to open until the timer is complete.  For example, if a user wants to stay away from their phone for a specific time, they can place their phone into the container, and they will not have access to their phone until it allows you to re-enter a password.

For more information, look at the [Final Documentation](https://github.com/aidree3/Addiction-Prevention-Safe/blob/master/Milestones/Final%20Project%20Detailed%20Design%20Report%20.pdf) file for in depth documentation.
